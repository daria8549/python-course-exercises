# python-course-exercises

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts from my university coursework in programming and data structures. The exercises cover a range of foundational topics in Python, including:

- Functions and classes
- Searching and sorting
- Data structures (lists, arrays, dictionaries)
- Binary trees and tree traversal
- Hashing and hash tables

The code is structured as standalone exercises, written and tested during practical lab sessions. These files reflect my learning progress and hands-on work throughout the course.

> Note: These are educational exercises and may not reflect production-level code.
