# Python Course Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts created during university coursework, tutorials, and exam preparation. These exercises reflect practical hands-on training in programming, data structures, and basic algorithm design.

## Contents

The exercises cover a wide range of foundational topics in Python:

- Functions and custom classes
- String manipulation and control structures
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- Linked lists and binary trees
- Hash tables and hashing logic
- Recursion and algorithm tracing
- Tutorial and in-class programming drills
- Exam-style practice problems

## File Structure

- `Exam_*.ipynb` – Exam preparation notebooks with focused algorithm exercises
- `Ass*.ipynb` – Assignments on data structures, sorting, trees, and hashing
- `Exercises_*.ipynb` – Thematic exercises (e.g., sorting, hash tables)
- `Tutorial * - Exercises.ipynb` – Guided tutorial sessions with in-class tasks
- `InClass_exercises.ipynb` – Mixed problems from lectures or labs
- `data/` – (Optional) Supporting datasets for selected exercises

## Notes

- All files are standalone notebooks unless stated otherwise.
- These notebooks are part of the coursework for an introductory programming and data structures class.
- Code is educational and optimized for clarity, not production use.
